# Moonshot

This is Project 8 of 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/moonshot-introduction)). The project is an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program.

As usual, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges that I will implement on my own in separate commits.

## Challenges

**Challenge #1**: Add the launch date to MissionView, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.

**Challenge #2**: Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in MissionView is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the Rectangle dividers out too

**Challenge #3**: For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to ContentView that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.
