# Moonshot

This is Project 8 of 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/moonshot-introduction)). The project is an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program.

As usual, at the end of the guided tutorial there will be three challenges that I will implement on my own in separate commits.
